## Our values  
<ol>
We will create a system that serves the people.
We will build a country where even the lowest paid worker can live comfortably.
We will create stronger communities within Ireland.
We will create a country where infrastructure is kept up to date and built correctly at the correct price and properly planned in a timely manner.
We will provide proper neutrality without reliance on other nations for our defense. 
We will create a country that thinks about future generations.
We want the country of Ireland to be a self-sufficient as possible.
</ol>
## Housing/Homelessness
### Homelessness
We believe that housing is a right and we want to move away from it being used as an investment or financial asset. We believe every person and animal deserves shelter and proper public services in regards to housing.
Our goal is to break the pattern of homelessness and create more housing for the people of Ireland.
This will include nationally run youth cafés, which would be put down to the youth services. This gives young people and children a place to wash clothes, get something to eat, stay warm and socialize. The abilities of these cafés would include:
<ul>
Free food
Free laundry
Free counseling once a week for each child.
A place to make friends.
A way to keep children off the streets.
Lessons on life skills. (Cooking, cleaning etc.)
</ul>
There are currently 3000+ children homeless right now and much more disadvantaged youth who could use these services.
The 2022 census showed over 166K+ vacant dwellings, these could be used for emergency housing for the homeless. Dublin city holds 30% of the country’s vacant housing.
We will build more state run soup kitchens for those who have fallen on hard times.
We will introduce state run free rehab centres with life skill lessons and mental health assistance for the mentally-ill and drug users to stop the pattern linked to homelessness.
We aim to end Ireland’s dependency on charity organizations. 
We will raise the wage of the average social worker and further persuade people to work in the industry to slow homelessness.
### Housing
The 2022 census showed over 166K+ vacant dwellings, these could be used for emergency housing for the homeless. Dublin city holds 30% of the country’s vacant housing.
We will raise a housing strategy similar to that in Finland, housing before all, where those deemed as ‘homelessness’ are given homes if they accept rehab for addiction or whatever else if it is deemed they need it. This won't be emergency accommodation.
Outside homelessness, new schemes will be created for those straight out of college/apprenticeships or general first time buyers to get their own home. Properties will be given to young people, families and other renters before any corporation.
New accommodation will be built en masse in prime locations, in every town not just Dublin and Cork, though those cities will receive priority to start.
Housing will become a constitutional right. It is guaranteed to every Irish citizen.
A cap will be placed on how much housing a person can own. A cap will also be placed on how much can be charged for rent.
Local authorities will be given the funding to buy vacant property and sell them on to those who need them the most.
Student accommodation will become more affordable and plentiful. 
We will ban five day a week rentals. And a bigger ban on vulture funds and non residents of Ireland buying up housing and farmlands.
## Healthcare
Ultimately the issues of the HSE come down to this;
<ul>
A complete reconstruction of leadership
A crackdown on nepotism and incompetence
A redesign to fit a more regional structure.
Money being put into the right places such as step down beds and raised pay for staff.
Reopening hospitals and building more where needed, not to mention hiring staff.
Having more insulated prefabs with proper beds if needed, no billion euro hospital needed.
Enacting the sláintecare plan, in it’s entirety 
More HSE gps
</ul>
Overall, we will make a more concerted effort to make sure that funds for the HSE are sent exactly where they need to be, not into a black hole or into the pockets of corrupt leadership. We will also make sure new leadership is put in place to bring the hse back up to scratch and back into a healthy posture once again.
## Transport
### Greater Dublin
We will try to grant the planning permission for metrolink and even add a second line, as the use for it right now is limited due to its size. The introduction of a vast metro connection can be more reliable due to not intertwining with regular roads, and it saves space above ground for buses, buildings etc.
We will make the process of adding bus routes, and buses to routes easier, so we can extend the reach of Bus Éireann, go ahead, Dublin bus etc. and their frequency. We will begin the process of making every bus a hydrogen one, it is good for the climate and cheaper to upkeep, which means saved cost for more buses.
We will upgrade the rail on every commuter train in the county and beyond, introducing more modern trains in the fleet. We can even construct new train stations if necessary. We would introduce more rail lines around the area, especially ones that can connect one town better to another. Take for example: Western Wicklow. We would introduce a line going through there that can start at Tallaght and end at Carlow. It would be an easier way for those in Carlow and even beyond to get into South Dublin without needing to go back from Heuston.
All metros/trains will need to be extended to all major colleges if they aren't already so there's no reliance on buses to take students to and from the campus.
The D.A.R.T will be extended all across Dublin's coast and beyond, hopefully into Meath or even Louth if possible. We would bring the D.A.R.T too into Kildare, Wicklow and Dublins surrounding counties that commute regularly into Dublin.
### Outside Dublin
Luas lines or even metros if possible will be constructed in every major Irish city, with hydrogen urban-buses in every medium-sized Irish town. Every neighborhood should have a bus stop or two if feasible.
Much more railway lines will be constructed, there are a lot of towns in western Ireland particularly that have absolutely no rail network. Take for example: Kanturk in North-Cork where there used to be one, towns like these will have a connecting railway to the main line from Dublin to Cork.
Local links will be given a massive boost to produce new routes, we will try and get them to as many homes as possible in and out of the motorway, and even establish bus stops in spread out areas so there's a definite location they can all go to.
If a train station is particularly far from the city center and other car parks for collection, we would propose a smaller bus to and from the train station to bring people around.
We will bring in new buses and trains for rural people, not just old models. Dublin bus style hydrogen buses will be introduced across every city.
New train stations will be constructed, Around Kinsale and the surrounding areas of Cork City for example, where none lay. It will drastically help commuters and it will bring an end to a reliance on buses or cars.
### Nationwide resolutions
We will cap the prices at a lower scale than before, to better encourage the use of transit in every corner of the country. Students and Children would receive the lowest fares.
We will heavily increase punishments for late drivers and anti-social behaviour.
We will vastly increase the frequency of all forms of transportation.
We will set up a county based transit system, increasing budgets for each county depending on their size. Connecting them all with Provincial transit systems will be added too. 
More focus will be put on especially underdeveloped systems within the country, such as the Shannon area and the aforementioned Donegal county area, getting better transit connections to major cities like Limerick for the former and Derry for the latter as an example.
We will introduce the double decker train, it improves capacity for every journey, especially those going to and from airports and other outside towns into a major city. Much like the system in Berlin.
We will introduce High Speed Rail to Ireland. These trains would take you from Cork/Galway to Dublin in about an hour - an hour and half. A major cut down from the roughly 2 hours and 40 minutes it is on regular rail. 
## Irish language
## Courses and community centers
We will start by setting aside a larger budget for Irish language classes for a large number of towns in the country, every town is to have an Irish youth centre, an elderly communal centre and a basic ‘comhrá/Conversation’ area for all ages. have ‘comhrá/Conversation’ sessions in the classes, teach the essentials and be proactive with adapting the information into regular day-to-day. Life like texting, emails, conversations, meetings etc. 
Community centres would have: A gaa/rugby/Basketball (and/or) a soccer pitch, a badminton/tennis court and a lounge area, (any console, computer etc. should have Irish set as the primary language). A library with plenty of Irish books.
The centers would sponsor sports clubs whenever possible. They would also hold sports events.
Hold other non-athletic competitions, music for example. Use techniques above to encourage involvement.
Create courses for ISL, and easier base-level courses for disadvantaged or foreign students attending, offer different online/offline textbooks and websites for whatever is their mother tongue to help them learn with what is familiar to them. 
## Online Irish learning software
It would be a system where you can take online courses to learn every level of Irish, for starting from the bottom, to fluency. There are exams you can take alongside the courses, textbooks if that’s what you are in tune with.  Live lectures are available, and they could/are encouraged to be taken in every communal centre. There can be courses that adhere to every form of learning.
It will be completely free, to take anytime, anywhere.
Should the project be received well, we would bring in other courses like music lessons, software lessons and more that will be taught in Irish, so you can practice your Irish while learning another skill.
Seachtain na Gaeilge will be a far more significant event across all of Ireland, in and out of education. Fairs will be held in honour of the week. Irish primary and Secondary schools will take part in fun activities throughout the week. Especially those that students find interesting, and that will improve their Irish.
Culture
We will Increase funding for the arts, particularly street art, theatre, films and music in Irish.
We will allocate more abandoned buildings in the country for street art. Street art in general will be more supported.
Irish language theatre productions will be given more focus in the isle, funding will be increased and pay for these productions will too, in order to encourage more adults to learn the language over just children in education
We will create schemes to apply for funding for the creation of short films, hold regular film festivals for them, and build a lot more cinemas like the lighthouse cinema in Smithfield, Dublin that specialize in shorter, off the grid movies and films. Added focus will be put on Irish short films as well, including their own film festival.
We will give incentives for small businesses to host bands and smaller musicians at their venues, we also want to invest in bringing back Ireland’s nightlife. We want to give Ireland another ‘third place’ that isn’t the bar or any other drinking activity.
We will take more interest in the eurovision.
## Defence
Ireland is a small democratic island nation located in North-Western Europe with a small population of 5 million as of 2023. Ireland is also a member of the EU & currently maintains a status of non-alignment with a history of UN, NPFP & EU deployments taskings.
Since the early days of the state, Many governments have neglected national security. Primarily its enforcers, the Irish Defence Forces. We at Roots find this thoroughly unacceptable.
It is within our belief that Ireland as a sovereign country should be able to fully protect the state and its citizens by standing up for itself. At sea, On land & In the air. Whilst also contributing to many Aid to civil power taskings & Peacekeeping/Humanitarian missions. By means of a fully staffed & Equipped Defence Forces, one with fair pay & conditions and reference to the CoDF Level of ambition 3+. It is also within our belief that Ireland should uptake a status of Armed neutrality by implementation into the constitution & international conventions, as well by ensuring the DF is fit for purpose.
And finally, we believe that the role of Minister for Defence should be separated from foreign affairs with both ministries.
## Social Services
We will increase pay for social workers.
We will set up a specific department to deal with social issues. Like an umbrella department. This department could work alongside the department of youth and child affairs.
We will decrease the reliance on non governmental organizations for mental health, especially with pieta house.
We will lower the requirement for 3rd level social service courses.
## Agriculture and rural affairs
We want to build a country that is as self sufficient as possible, where the supply chain & system is not only flexible but secure. Our major economic plan is a green agricultural revolution fuelling a green industrial revolution nationwide. 
Our main plan is to follow our ecosystem by the means of Agroecology, to get our environment back to what it previously was, through holistic agricultural land management led by maintaining traditional practices & bringing back the biodiversity lost over the centuries.
We oppose the current environmental doctrine that views people & production as oppositional to environmentalism. Harmony can be achieved with our natural ecosystem & farming can thrive alongside the flora & fauna, they can benefit one another. 
We oppose harmful policies such as rewetting & instead favour initiatives like native natural species based silvopasture as the majority of areas that are now peatland are now being considered for rewetting were in fact Atlantic temperate rainforests managed through grazing prior to the colonization period which turned into rainfed bogs after the forests had been felled. 
We propose a closed loop system of production & to localize the product of our land as close to source when possible via cooperative industry revitalizing our villages, towns & cities by providing sustainable development. We wish to do the same by reclaiming the sovereignty of our waters for our coastal communities 
Among things we want to protect as well as traditional turf cutting are as follows:
<ol>
Traditional fairs & markets, be they of horses, livestock or general goods.
Timber cutting for personal use & the harvesting of material for & the practices of thatching, basket weaving & hedge craft.
The fishing rights of our fishermen even if we do temporarily halt the fishing with the marine preserve.
The rights of our farmers to farm their land & their rights to practice their traditional farming practices
The rights of our people in general to enjoy nature, the countryside & public space 
The rights of our travelers to practice their culture & be provisioned for with amenities in a way that does not disturb the rights of others & takes them out of conflict with other sections of the population.
</ol>
## Education
Education Our primary objective with regards to education is to reduce unnecessary pressure on students, taking a more vocational educational approach to any career that is not purely academic widening the net of professions that can be worked towards via apprenticeship & on the job training.
Alongside that our objective is changing the basic curriculum to be more practical but also more flexible, teaching children to think critically & pursue what they are passionate about rather than rabbiting off sections of textbooks on command. 
We also want a larger focus on practical life skills, teaching children how to cook, sew, maintain a home, start an enterprise, drive, maintain a vehicle & get manual certifications such as manual handling, safe pass & heavy machinery cards should it appeal to them via the school.
